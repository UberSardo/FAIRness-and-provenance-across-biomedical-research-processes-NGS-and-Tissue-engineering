W3C PROV-DM has been used as a standard for building two provenance models for two distinct processes:

-COVID-19 tracking process (Illumina WGS)

-Cardiac tissue model engineering (Tissue Engineering) 

The models were developed under the project "Metodi e tecnologie per la modellazione, la gestione e l’analisi di dati e immagini relativi a processi clinici e biotecnologia industriale” hosted by CRS4 and funded by Sardegna Ricerche ("https://www.sardegnaricerche.it/index.php?xsl=558&tipodoc=2&s=13&v=9&c=3168&c1=3168&id=88765&va=").

Every folder contain a .png flowchart that explains the process, a .ttl serialisation and a .png picture that shows the provenance model.

Both an .ipynb and .py are present for every model.
Two more simplified models were develop for the NGS use case and another one for the Tissue Engineering use case.

NGS process 
The use case process is a COVID-19 tracking (WGS) performed using Illumina technologies and methods at CRS4 NGS Laboratory.

Tissue Engingeering
Cardiac tissue model engineering where a mature cardiac tissue is produced starting from cell isolation and scaffold preparation to incubation and maturation with final  assay performed at the University of Basel from the Cardiac Surgery and Tissue Engineering Group.
