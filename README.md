Provenance models for an NGS and a tissue engineering process.
Every folder contain a .png flowchart that explains the process, a .ttl serialisation and a .png picture that shows the provenance model.

The process considered are a COVID-19 tracking process performed using Illumina technologies and methods and a cardiac tissue model engineering where a mature cardiac tissue is produced and assayed.

The work was developed under the CRS4 hosting and Sardegna Ricerche funding.
